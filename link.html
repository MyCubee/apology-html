        <h1>PLEASE READ BABE</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>You're my friend, my best friend and my girlfriend, I still want you to remain my girlfriend</p>

<p>I know you might have thought we'd still be friends regardless of whether we broke up, and that's true but that's not what I want, you said life doesn't give you what you want and you take it and I'm going to start with you.<br />
That might sound cocky or weird even but that's the truth, I want you to remain my significant other, my partner in crime, my gist partner, my better half and my source of pride. I don't want to lose feelings for you because I'm too in love for that, this is not a casual fling where you tell me, let's breakup and I just smile and move on. I want you to remain my girlfriend, so I can love you more and more, and no I don't mean I can't love you regardless, I can but I'd rather much prefer it this way.</p>

<p>I know we talked about distractions, and you're right, we tend to be distractions to each other but I believe things will be much different in the coming sessions. But, I also don't completely agree with that statement, for some reasons, yes, we would get carried away but it didn't mean we didn't cover what we were supposed to before the exam, the subjects I had issues with were statistics, the exam was madness, from wrong questions to options and what not, physics, I didn't read enough due to laziness, and then csc, it was just a mess. I read stat, even confident about it, not your fault I got a B, it's just circumstances. Then physics, C, I was lazy and thought the tests had me covered but no, I've learnt don't relent because you could slack in the process, so greater or equivalent effort. CSC, the algorithm one, B, surprised I got a B in it and not C, it almost feels like my physics and csc are inverted but that's my score. In the end, I didn't put in the effort I should have, the day the CSC test was supposed to hold, I wasn't even aware, so I did not prepare, that's not your fault.</p> 

<p>You're not a distraction, at all, we fixed most of our misplaced priorities issue, that's why I was able to rise from 4.08 to 4.48, not completely fixed but enough to make me climb that far up, you're the reason I didn't slouch, you're the reason I come out to read and not get lost in CODM, you're the reason I didn't fall into depression in first semester, so you being a distraction is blatantly lying due to shown evidence and you're the reason I'll leave that school with first class.<br />
We should work on how we'll completely fixing as a power couple. I know you mentioned something about burden, you shoulder my burdens, you did after I saw my first semester result, till I got over it, you always do so, so I will never complain about shouldering yours, if you're going to mention that again, you may do so but don't make it in regards to me because I would do that without a moments thought, that's my job and I won't complain.</p>

<p>You told me to look at the positives and acknowledge the result, I'm going to do that now, it wasn't what I wanted but it was close and better than anything I've ever done. I got 88 A in mat102, the ones you thought me and we read together that I got A in, like French, Yoruba, Mat104, GST, were products of said "distraction".
Now, do you see how much you helped me improve, now I've learnt how to actually study and can start implementing it, I've never actually read or studied like that in my life, just crammed but now, thanks to you, I can study, thank you Ifeoluwa, those weren't distractions, those were products of our efforts.<br />
Of course I'm going to be sad when I get what I don't expect but you, through this, you taught me to acknowledge the effort put, take responsibility for effort not put and work towards putting better effort, I'm still in the healing phase. </p>

<p>I wouldn't want you to leave me now, you've been doing a lot, even putting up with my shenanigans, but please don't leave now, and don't let us go through with this breakup, I look forward to celebrating our anniversary every 19th. I promise, when we have Kids, we'll be refined enough to not pass on bad characters to them, especially me and especially not this. I really don't have a backward mentality, I promise to fix it and not let situations and circumstances give you that impression again. I'm not going to die for any reason, not when we're yet to enjoy life together, I really don't want to lose you as a future wife, please.
</p>

<p>Yes, I do think about you everyday, because I love you and you're my girlfriend for God's sake, of course I'd be worried a little after not talking to you for a while but now, trust me, things are going to be different, it's not in the way it's always been, that I get angry or something, I won't, now I've picked up writing code as a hobby and related activities, keeping myself occupied and busy, I'd still like us to call a lot regardless and we could only text when the other person is online, instead of spamming, like me that's always with my phone, whenever you're online, we'll just talk.<br />
So we'll approach it in a more positive manner which is still up for discussion.
</p>

<p>I just don't think a breakup is the fix all solution all the time, we can always approach things together, since two are better than one, then look at the best solution together babe.<br />
I don't want us to see our relationship as a couple as something we can just throw away and just lose just because something isn't going right or one of us is acting different or whatever the situation might be, but instead help and stand by each other through it.
</p>
<p>I love you and can we please not break up, I'd really appreciate that, if you made it this far, you can screenshot this paragraph and send your reply over text to me, I'd respect your decision regardless.</p>
