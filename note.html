    <ol>
        <li>Don't mind me, I don't have enough experience to make it look dazzling, don't worry, sooooonnn</li>
        <li>Purple because it's one of your favourites</li>
        <li>Brown because it matches with the color in the picture</li>
        <li>The picture because doesn't it look nice, yesterday Jessy asked me to send him one of his pics.<br />
        While doing so, I saw that picture and thought it was really nice
        </li>
        <li>I could have used emoji's where you see "insert emoji", I can but.....</li>
        <li>Everything else is laziness, I'm too lazy right now to even go through these files <em>insert tear drop emoji</em></li>
        <li> I might have to delete this because apparently it's public. But I don't really know the details <em>insert crying emoji</em></li>
    </ol>
